# Makeover Monday (MoM) - Week 32
**Remote Work**

## MoM Background
Makeover Monday is a weekly learning and development opportunity to work with a given data set and create better, more effective visualizations.  The goal with MoM is to make information more accessible, and participants are from around the world.  MoM is sponsored by Tableau.  Each week, sponsors post a visualization to be improved, along with a dataset for the original visualization.  Participants then make and share their vizs and the community gets smarter and more creative as a whole!

## Source Article and Viz
This week's Viz: Week 32 brings [a viz](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/how-people-and-companies-feel-about-working-remotely/) showing top reasons for remote work as percentage breakdown.

## Data Source
Data comes from Buffer's State of Remote Work Report and available [here](https://lp.buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2020).

## My Approach for Week 31
The original viz is a simple stacked bar plot showing the distribution of the top reasons people cited for wanting to remote work.  My approach is to change the measure into rankings, break the components into their own nouns, and graphically display in a pleasing manner.
